-- Create admin user (this will be done via Supabase Auth Admin API in the app)
-- This script documents the admin user creation process

-- The admin user will be created with:
-- Email: admin@admin.com  
-- Password: IParkAdmin@123
-- Role: manager
-- Full Name: Program Manager

-- Note: This will be executed via the application's admin user creation function
-- since we need to use Supabase Auth Admin API to create users with custom passwords
